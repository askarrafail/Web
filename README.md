WebProject 
OQU is a platform on which you submit your application for admission to the University, which applicants can use to apply to any of more than 125 Universities in Kazakhstan. The goal of our project is to create a platform that will ensure a high-quality admission process to universities in Kazakhstan. In conclusion, this project has a good future and I think this is only part of the digitalization of Kazakhstan.
